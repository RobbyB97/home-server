      What is a perfect website? One that is 
      <i>
        memorable
      </i>
      , 
      <i>
        simplistic
      </i>
      , 
      <i>
        intuitive
      </i>
       and 
      <i>
        fast
      </i>
       would be my answer. However, every person has their own vision of the perfect website for themselves or their company. My mission is to take that vision and make it a reality.
